            <p>
                <strong>Your responsibility:</strong> Don't abuse the Extension, don't violate Amazon's terms, and don't blame us if Amazon suspends your account (we can't control that).

            <p>
                <strong>Privacy:</strong> We literally don't collect ANY data. Check our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for proof.
